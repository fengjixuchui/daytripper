## How it works

Daytripper comes in two parts: a Transmitter (TX) and a Receiver (RX).

Mount the TX in the path of incoming threat. Plug RX into your computer.

When motion is detected, RX will press `Win + M` and instantly hide what you're doing.

Alternatively, it can also lock your PC or [execute a custom script](/advanced_usage.md).
